# Calendar Clock

Displays the time plus your next few calendar events.

Requires my Calendar Sync app, the Android integration and my hacked version of Messages to read calendar data, plus GadgetBridge and a Tasker profile on the phone to send the data every few hours.

## Media controls

Tap the calendar to switch to media control mode. Tap the track name to go back to calendar mode.

Requires the Android integration app and GadgetBridge on the phone to control music.

Track information doesn't always synch perfectly but the controls should work regardless.
